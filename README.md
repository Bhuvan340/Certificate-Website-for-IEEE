# Certificate Website for IEEE
This project is a web-based Certificate Distribution System developed for IEEE events, designed to streamline the process of issuing certificates to participants. The system is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, with Firebase handling the backend for secure storage of participant emails. Participants can easily enter their email addresses to retrieve their personalized certificates, which are generated and made available for download in PNG format. This efficient, user-friendly platform simplifies certificate management and ensures participants can quickly access their certificates, eliminating manual distribution.
